I created a gif to humorously start a presentation on monitoring model performance and model updating strategies. The gif was built using the R packages animation, extrafonts, ggplot2, and xkcd. Feel free to use the <a href="https://github.com/ChrisDienes/ModelGoBoom" target="_blank">code</a>  to jump start your own xkcd-styled stickperson gif. The current version should generate the below gif:

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}.$$
