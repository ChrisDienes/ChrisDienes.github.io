I created a scavenger hunt for my wife's birthday this past year. The major hurdles were:

1. Planning her day. This included coordinating with friends and local businesses (donuts, golf, spa, lunch, library, movie, etc.).  
2. Creating a static webpage to guide her experience. The application uses JavaScript to decode a series of clues.   
3. Planting the clues. I placed an icon on her iPhone and hid several physical clues which are no longer active so don't think you can recreate the experience.

I chose GitHub for my static hosting, which gave me the motivation to finally create a public repository for my codes. A few months and repos later, I now have a place to blog about my DIY projects. Naturally, this is my first post.
