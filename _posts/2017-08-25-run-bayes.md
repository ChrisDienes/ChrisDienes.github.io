Like many people at the start of a new year, my wife and I will set goals/resolutions/ToDos for the upcoming 365 days. In 2016 I had the crazy idea of running 1000 miles in 52 weeks. This translates to 20 miles per week for 50 weeks with a 2 week buffer. I should mention this was an ambitious goal since my lifetime annual record was most likely in the range of 200-400 miles, and I wasn't actively running prior to the start of my 1000 mile goal. 

Being a data scientist, I decided to model my chance of success. The gif at the top of the page displays the simulated cummulative paths based on my final Bayesian model. The path results were updated after each passing week. Below I describe my model for anyone interested. My data, code, and some output from the analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/ChrisDienes/runBayes" target="_blank">here</a>. 

<strong>What I learned from all this?</strong> I. Hate. Running. Although I accomplished my fitness goal and ended with 1001 miles, it's very unlikely I will run 1000 miles in a year ever again. The time commitment was a little more than I had anticipated and the repetitive excerise led to problems with my physical health. After 900 miles or so I developed a stress fracture in my right ankle which took ~6 months to heal. The lenghty recovery is likely due to the fact that I ran the last ~100 miles in pain just for the sake of accomplishing my goal.     

<h3>What I tried</h3>

<h3>My Final Model</h3>

I decided to perform a Bayesian analysis with priors selected to achieve a 50% initial success likelihood. The result is depicted in the following gif:
