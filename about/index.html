	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div style="width:100%;margin:0 auto;">
	  <div style="width:50%;">
		<p>Iâ€™m a classically trained data scientist with degrees in mathematics (Montana Tech, BS) and statistics (UC Davis, PhD). During the day I solve analytics problems for a major technology manufacturer, but I have also been known to use data recreationally. Most of my posts will be about my personal data science DIY projects. Perhaps some of these will be useful or entertaining to you.</p>
		<p>Likes: dogs, food, music, puzzles</p>
		<p>Dislikes: cats, iron-deficient soil, north-facing driveways</p>
